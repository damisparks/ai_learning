# Data Fit and Annotation

This article covers how data can affect a machine learning model's performance and see how to create your labelled dataset using Appen's annotation platform.

> Data Annotation is also known as Data Labelling.

## Scope

By the end of the article, you should have the essential information you need to build a data annotation of your own.

## Answering Questions with Data.

### Building a dataset.

In this section, I discuss how you can build a dataset with the business problem.

When building a dataset for the problem, ask yourself :

- does the dataset fit the problem
- is the dataset complete (_whether a data-set is complete and if it contains enough information to represent all real world use cases_)
- how can you annotate a dataset and ensure the data quality and user experience over time (_strategy for ensuring data quality and user experience_)

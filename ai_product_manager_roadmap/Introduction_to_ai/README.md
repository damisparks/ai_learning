# Introduction to AI in Business

## What is AI

AI has several definitions.
Most typically today, **AI** stands for **[Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)**.
However, more recently the abbreviation can also stand
for **[Augmented Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification)**.

According to [Andrew Moore, dean of computer science at the Carnegie Mellon](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/)

> defines AI as the science and engineering of making computers
> behave in ways that until recently, we thought required human intelligence.

## What Can AI Do ?

- [Facial recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_recognition_system)
- [Automatic text recognition or Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)
- [Semantic segmentation](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tingwuwang/semantic_segmentation.pdf)

### What is Machine Learning:

It is a branch of artificial intelligence,
as simply put by [Tom Michael Mitchell, Professor at the Carnegie Mellon University.](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/),

> Computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience, pretty simple.

## AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Misconception

Now, the question on your mind might be :

- What characteristic does deep learning have, that traditional machine learning does not?

> The most important difference between deep learning and traditional machine learning is its performance as the scale of data increases. When the data is small, deep learning algorithms don't perform that well. This is because deep learning algorithms need a large amount of data to understand it perfectly. Simple put Deep learning uses multilayered neural networks to learn from large datasets.

**Another way to see it is**: _Deep learning specifically refers to algorithms that use neural networks, which you'll learn more about, later in this lesson! This approach relies on vast amounts of data to work._

That said, it lead to the another question. 👇🏾

## Why Deep Learning

DL simply can can process and learn from much, much more data than previous approaches.

Interesting this article, [Andrew Ng: Why AI Is the New Electricity
](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/andrew-ng-why-ai-new-electricity) talks about how AI will affect industry, he said

### The New Electricity

> Just as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don’t think AI will transform in the next several years. **- Andrew Ng**

Now, let's a take dive into the machine learning techniques.

## Machine Learning Technique

They are:

- Supervised learning,
- Unsupervised learning, and
- Reinforcement learning.

**[Supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning#:~:text=Supervised%20learning%20is%20the%20machine,a%20set%20of%20training%20examples.)** _uses pre-labeled data to train a model to predict new outcomes for information that hasn't been exposed to before. Examples are :_

- Classification
- Regression

**[Unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning#:~:text=Unsupervised%20learning%20is%20a%20type,a%20minimum%20of%20human%20supervision.)** _uses non-labeled data and self organizes to predict patterns or outcomes such as clustering or associations. Examples are :_

- Anomaly detection
- Clustering
- Neural Networks

**[Reinforcement learning](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning#:~:text=Reinforcement%20learning%20(RL)%20is%20an,supervised%20learning%20and%20unsupervised%20learning.>)** _is giving feedback to an algorithm when
it does something right or wrong based on a discrete outcome,
this can either be in real time or offline._
